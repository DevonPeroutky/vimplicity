## The Why

The goal of this is to provide a complete Neovim setup out-of-the-box that can
still be configured and extended by advanced users. This project accomplishes
this through a curated collection of plugins that work well together to provide
minimal IDE experience in neovim.

- ðŸ“¦ **Easy**: Getting setup is simple
- ðŸš€ **Featured**: [LSP support](https://github.com/neoclide/coc.nvim), Folding, Fuzzy Finding,  Sidebar, and so much more.
- ðŸ”Œ **Configurable**: Easily add, configure, and extend as you would with plain Neovim

## Installation

TBD. Look at `steps.sh`....
