# Productionize
- Vim-Cheatsheet
- Cleanup / reorganize
- Documentation commands and key mappings
- Move default config location for neovim

    - The complete overwrite should handle both installs and updates

# Dream Big
- CLI for installing, configuring, and updating the setup
  - Auto updating
  - View, Install, Remove, and Update Plugins
  - View, Edit, Add, Remove [Hotkeys, AutoCommands, Listeners]?
